### 1. Customer Project Requirements ###

1. Customer Project Analysis 
	- Who is the customer ?
	- What the buyer gets ?
2. RAW Project Description 

    Implement a Estate Rent Managment System. System is separated in three parts based on roles provided by system. The roles are - **not specified user** ( user that is not selected a role, not loged or fully registered ), a **personal** use user ( user that can manage owned or rented home), a **bussines user** ( selling agent / renteer / rent agent ). As a PERSONAL - the user must be able to add bills to the estete he ownes. As PERSONAL he must able to add other PERSONAL OR NOT PERSONAL users to the estate. As BUSSINESS user he must be able to post a ESTATE FOR SALE OR RENT and other users must find this post and chose what to do. In addition the P/B Users must have social network like page to see the posted B User offers. The Bussines user must have owne administration pannel, in other words part of system for compate busssines managment. System must be more like social network for posting estates for rent and selling. Based on roles the user can post or bye/become renter. User that are buying can get a home managment service. Every role must have extras and limitations that can be unlocked by paying for that service. So in the start of the system must be provided services for basic use and payed use.
